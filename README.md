# Women Safety Data Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a data analytics approach to understanding women safety–related incidents using **Python in Google Colab**. The analysis focuses on cleaning raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing patterns to identify frequent incident types and high-risk locations. The project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics in addressing real-world social challenges.
